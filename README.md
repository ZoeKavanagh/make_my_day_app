# Make My Day

Make My Day is a group web application for organising days out. The app is supposed to act as a solution for friends who can never decide on days when they are all free. With this web application, users can create a group together, interact with a calendar and speak via a posts section in order to decide on a date, location, budget, and type of activity. They can then fill out a form with this information, and the application does the rest! Make My Day makes a request to our Clint API, which uses the information given to filter through its database, and return only relevant events for the group to do!

This has been a collaborative project worked on by four developers.

### Functionality

A user can fill out a make my day form from the home page without logging in if they want to. A user can log in with their google account to create groups with other existing users. When creating a group, the user must give the group a name, and select the other users they want to add to the group. Once a group is created, the users share a group page, where they can chat to each other, use an interactive calendar, and fill out a make my day form.

Upon completion of a make my day form, a request is sent to our [Clint API](https://github.com/afishcalledrob/clint_api), which takes the data given by the users, and returns a list of events that meets their requirements.

For the purposes of this project, we created our own API and therefore seeded its database with data we had researched ourselves. As a result, the API will only respond to requests for the month of July 2018.



### Organisation

We organised our workflow using Trello, splitting all tasks into manageable tickets. We worked in pairs every day, deciding what needed to be done in daily morning standups, and we would review our progress, as well as our thoughts and concerns during afternoon retrospectives.
