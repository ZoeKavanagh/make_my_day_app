# Make My Day

Make My Day is a group web application for organising days out. The app is supposed to act as a solution for friends who can never decide on days when they are all free. With this web application, users can create a group together, interact with a calendar and speak via a posts section in order to decide on a date, location, budget, and type of activity. They can then fill out a form with this information, and the application does the rest! Make My Day makes a request to our Clint API, which uses the information given to filter through its database, and return only relevant events for the group to do!

This has been a collaborative project worked on by four developers.

### Organisation

We organised our workflow using Trello, splitting all tasks into manageable tickets. We worked in pairs every day, deciding what needed to be done in daily morning standups, and we would review our progress, as well as our thoughts and concerns during afternoon retrospectives.
